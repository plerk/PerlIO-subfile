PerlIO/subfile version 0.01
===========================

A layer for the PerlIO system to limit you to subsection of a file.

YOU NEED PERL 5.7.0 or later
                            yes. this only works on UNSTABLE DEVELOPMENT PERL

Currently read only.

WHY?

zip files (and other archive files) contain multiple other files within them.
If the contained file is stored uncompressed then it would be nice to save
copying it out, and instead give a file handle onto the subfile which behaves
as if the temporary copy has taken place, but actually reads from the original
zip.  Basically all you need to do is nobble seek and tell so that file offsets
are given from the start of the contained file (and you can't seek your way
outside the bounds), and read so that EOF happens in the right place.

(Reading files from inside uncompressed tar files or any other sort of
archive format is just the same)

Yes, you can nest them. sub subfiles. :-)
