      Change to use the modified layer API of 5.7.1
      As the pushed argument is now an SV, allow an SV that is an IV/UV
      (but not a PV) is treated as a relative end value. (which will make
      things easier for ex::lib::zip

      By 5.7.2 it seems that the pushed argument is passed in as &sv_undef
      rather than NULL. I wasn't testing SvOK() and was getting use of
      uninitialized value errors.
      Changed tests to use Test::More, set $!=0 whenever we report it on !ok().
      Fixed test "Binmode should take us to the start of the subfile" to
      actually test tell(), rather than another needless seek.
      Fixed => to => in two of the assertions. Fixed a bug in another assertion.
      Looks like I'd not built against a -g perl for a while.
